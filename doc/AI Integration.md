# MIDI Router Configuration (AI integration)

This document provides a human-readable configuration reference for the [MIDI Router Client](https://sourceforge.net/projects/midi-router-client/). It is designed to assist AI agents—like Copilot—in understanding the current configuration and helping users make updates to the `MidiRouterClient.json` file added to context.

## Presets Overview

Only presets marked as **enabled** are active. The preset marked as **selected** is currently chosen for editing, determined by `_activePresetID`.

```json
{
  "_activePresetID": 0,
  "midiRoutePresets": [
    { "isEnabled": true, "name": "1st" },
    { "isEnabled": false, "name": "second" }
  ]
}
```

---

## Port Connectivity Requirements

For routing to function correctly, the specified input and output ports must exist and be connected.

```json
{
  "connectedInPorts": [
    "0_Scarlett 2i4 USB",
    "0_Launch Control XL",
    "0_Launch Control XL HUI"
  ],
  "connectedOutPorts": [
    "0_Scarlett 2i4 USB",
    "0_Launch Control XL",
    "0_Launch Control XL HUI"
  ]
}
```

## MIDI Router Chains and Filters

### `midiRouterChains`

`midiRouterChains` define the routing logic for MIDI events. Each chain consists of a sequence of `midiRoutersFilters` that process and transform MIDI data as it passes through.

### `midiRoutersFilters`

`midiRoutersFilters` apply conditions and transformations to MIDI events. Below are details for the two main filter types found in the configuration:

#### Filter Type 4: FILTER_AND_TRANSFORM

This filter type allows for both filtering and transforming MIDI event data. The transformation notation is:

- `[[fromStart, fromEnd, toStart, toEnd]]` — maps the range `fromStart` to `fromEnd` onto `toStart` to `toEnd`.
- `[[fromStart, fromEnd, toStart]]` — short form, where `toEnd = toStart + (fromEnd - fromStart)`.
- `[[value1, value2]]` — maps `value1` to `value2`.
- `[[value]]` — equivalent to `[[value, value]]`, a single value mapping.

**Parameters:**
- `conditionAction`: Controls event deletion:
  - `0` (DO_NOT_DELETE): Always pass the event.
  - `1` (DELETE_IF_NOT_MET_CONDITION): Delete if filter conditions are not met.
  - `2` (DELETE_IF_MET_CONDITION): Delete if filter conditions are met.
- `filterChannel`: MIDI channel(s) to filter, using the notation above.
- `filterData1`: Data1 byte filter and transformation, using the notation above.
- `filterData2`: Data2 byte filter and transformation, using the notation above.
- `filterEvents`: List of MIDI event types to filter (e.g., `[8]` for Note On).
- `filterType`: Set to `4` for this filter.
- `name`: Filter name.
- `uuid`: Unique identifier.

**Example:**
```json
{
  "conditionAction": 1,
  "filterChannel": "[[6, 6]]",
  "filterData1": "[[19, 74, 19]]",
  "filterData2": "[[0, 127, 0, 255]]",
  "filterEvents": "[[8], [9]]",
  "filterType": 4,
  "name": "EasyConfig",
  "uuid": "a0ceaa75-1273-46b5-8159-30f41e0e1251"
}
```
This filter applies to channel 6, transforms data1 from 19–74 to 19–(19+55), and data2 from 0–127 to 0–255, for Note On (8) and Note Off (9) events. If the condition is not met, the event is deleted.

#### Filter Type 0: TO_MIDI_DESTINATION

This filter type routes MIDI events to a specific MIDI destination.

**Parameters:**
- `filterType`: Set to `0` for this filter.
- `midiInputName`: Name of the MIDI input port.
- `uuid`: Unique identifier.

**Example:**
```json
{
  "filterType": 0,
  "midiInputName": "0_Scarlett 2i4 USB",
  "uuid": "ae0a5872-a825-43f4-bb0e-ed4fa1700112"
}
```
This filter routes events from the specified input port to the MIDI destination.

---

## Preset Activation via MIDI Commands

Presets can be controlled with MIDI events—**On**, **Off**, **Select** (On and selected), and **Toggle**.

- If `portName` is empty for a command, that trigger is ignored.
- `presetMidiType` codes:
  - `0` = Off
  - `1` = On
  - `2` = Toggle
  - `3` = Select

### MIDI Event Type Mapping

```json
[
  { "value": 0, "text": "[] - -" },
  { "value": 1, "text": "[8, 9] - Note on/off" },
  { "value": 2, "text": "[9] - Note off" },
  { "value": 3, "text": "[8] - Note on" },
  { "value": 4, "text": "[10] - Key Aftertouch" },
  { "value": 5, "text": "[11] - Control Change" },
  { "value": 7, "text": "[100] - NRPN" },
  { "value": 8, "text": "[12] - Program Change" },
  { "value": 9, "text": "[13] - Channel Aftertouch" },
  { "value": 10, "text": "[14] - Pitch Bend" }
]
```

## Preset MIDI Control Configuration

```json
{
  "midiRoutePresets": [
    {
      "isEnabled": true,
      "name": "Deep Mind",
      "midiControlOff": {
        "eventTypeId": 3,
        "portName": "0_Launch Control XL",
        "presetMidiType": 0
      },
      "midiControlOn": {
        "data1": 73,
        "eventTypeId": 2,
        "portName": "0_Launch Control XL",
        "presetMidiType": 1
      },
      "midiControlSelect": {
        "data1": 73,
        "eventTypeId": 2,
        "portName": "",
        "presetMidiType": 3
      },
      "midiControlToggle": {
        "eventTypeId": 0,
        "portName": "",
        "presetMidiType": 2
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## Preset User Controls

Each preset may include interactive controls such as sliders, optionally paired with dropdowns if `isShowDropdown` is true.

Only the controls from the currently selected preset (`_activePresetID`) are presented in the UI—controls from other enabled presets are not shown.

```json
"userControls": [
  {
    "ccId": 0,
    "channelId": 1,
    "description": "Description",
    "dropdownListUuid": "50fda87a-6c8b-46b2-a104-1c2026b2dd58",
    "eventType": 0,
    "inputVal": 1,
    "is64Mode": false,
    "isSendOnPresetChange": false,
    "isShowDropdown": true,
    "maxVal": 127,
    "minVal": 0,
    "nrpnControl": 0,
    "outputPortnName": "",
    "uuid": "cc12cc7a-e1f1-4066-ad7c-66e76f6798b1"
  }
]
```

- `userControls` are interactive UI sliders.
- If `isShowDropdown` is true, a dropdown is shown **in addition to** the slider.
- `eventType` behavior:
  - `0` = CC → uses `ccId`
  - `1` = Program Change → ignores `ccId` and `nrpnControl`
  - `2` = NRPN → uses `nrpnControl`
- `channelId` is the MIDI channel for output.
- If `outputPortnName` is empty or disconnected, the control is not effective.
- `is64Mode` represents value `64` as center/zero (used in bipolar ranges).
- Dropdowns:
  - Values from `minVal` to `maxVal` are mapped to list items based on `dropdownListUuid`.
  - If the list is too short, missing entries are shown as numeric values starting from `minVal`.
  - Dropdown entries are stored as `\n`-separated text.

---

## Shared Dropdown Lists

Dropdown lists are globally defined and shared across all presets—there is no need to duplicate them for each preset.

```json
{
  "dropdownlists": [
    {
      "data": "line 1\nline 2",
      "name": "DM",
      "uuid": "4f10dc21-e30c-4d59-bd1b-3e4c575f10c8"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## EasyConfig Routing

EasyConfig routes are designed to spare users from manually configuring low-level routing logic via `midiRouterChains` and `midiRoutersFilters`.

- 🧠 AI agents should **always prefer modifying `easyConfigRoutes`** when possible, rather than altering `midiRouterChains` or `midiRoutersFilters`.
- 🧮 Filters in `midiRoutersFilters` may involve computation of linear transformations. These are **powerful but complex**, and should be reserved for advanced scenarios or absolute necessity.

### Network Destination Format

Routing destinations may include **network port addresses**, formatted as:

```
<address>:<port>/<destinationName>
```

Example:

```json
"toDestinationName": "localhost:12345/0_Scarlett 2i4 USB"
```

- This defines a network-based output port.
- AI agents **cannot determine** whether these network ports exist or are reachable.
- When assisting users, the agent should clarify that such ports might be available—depending on network configuration—but cannot verify their existence.

### Keyboard Split Routing

`easyConfigRoutes` may use `splitRangeId` to route **from** a keyboard split zone:

```json
"splitRangeId": 1
```

Keyboard splits are defined with:

```json
"keyboardSplits": [34, 74],
"zoneNames": ["Split 0", "Split 1", "Split 2"]
```

These define three split zones:

| Split ID | Range     |
|----------|-----------|
| 0        | 0–34      |
| 1        | 35–74     |
| 2        | 75–127    |

- `splitRangeId` is **from** a split zone.

### CC to NRPN Example

Here's a real-world example of routing a **Control Change (CC)** event to **NRPN**, using channel 6 for both, and mapping a value range from 0–127 to 0–255:

```json
{
  "midiRoutePresets": [
    {
      "midiRouteInputs": [
        {
          "midiInputName": "0_Launch Control XL",
          "easyConfig": {
            "easyConfigRoutes": [
              {
                "fromCcOrNrpnEnd": 127,
                "fromCcOrNrpnStart": 0,
                "fromChannel": 6,
                "fromData1": -1,
                "fromSelectedMidiEventTypeId": 5,
                "splitRangeId": -1,
                "toCcOrNrpnEnd": 255,
                "toCcOrNrpnStart": 0,
                "toChannel": 6,
                "toData1": 8,
                "toDestinationName": "localhost:12345/0_Scarlett 2i4 USB",
                "toSelectedMidiEventTypeId": 7,
                "transpose": 0,
                "uuid": "d3bc0cb8-0de6-43ec-94c5-91b4a6ed7c6d"
              }
            ],
            "keyboardSplits": [],
            "zoneNames": []
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

This transformation reflects a common pattern where NRPN values accommodate extended 8-bit ranges (0–255), exceeding standard CC ranges (0–127).

### Split to Destination Example

```json
{
  "midiRoutePresets": [
    {
      "midiRouteInputs": [
        {
          "midiInputName": "0_Launch Control XL",
          "easyConfig": {
            "easyConfigRoutes": [
              {
                "fromCcOrNrpnEnd": 127,
                "fromCcOrNrpnStart": 0,
                "fromChannel": 6,
                "fromData1": -1,
                "fromSelectedMidiEventTypeId": 5,
                "splitRangeId": -1,
                "toCcOrNrpnEnd": 255,
                "toCcOrNrpnStart": 0,
                "toChannel": 6,
                "toData1": 8,
                "toDestinationName": "localhost:12345/0_Scarlett 2i4 USB",
                "toSelectedMidiEventTypeId": 7,
                "transpose": 0,
                "uuid": "d3bc0cb8-0de6-43ec-94c5-91b4a6ed7c6d"
              }
            ],
            "keyboardSplits": [],
            "zoneNames": []
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Notes

### 🧼 Filter Simplification Rule

When explaining configurations to users, any filters using the value `-1` (such as `channel`, `data1`, `data2`) indicate no filtering—they allow all values to pass.  
These should be **omitted** in descriptions to improve clarity, since they have no practical effect on routing.

This rule applies across:
- `userControls`
- `midiControlOn`, `midiControlOff`, `midiControlSelect`, `midiControlToggle`
- Any other filter settings present elsewhere in the configuration

### 🔗 Auto-Generated Routing Chains

Entries in `midiRouterChains` with `"isEasyConfig": true` are automatically generated by the system—either for MIDI-triggered preset switching or for simplified routing logic via the EasyConfig UI.

These chains are considered **redundant for documentation and user editing**.  
- 🛑 Do not manually edit these chains.  
- 🧠 AI agents and users should ignore them when reviewing or discussing routing logic.  
- ✏️ Focus only on custom-defined chains or EasyConfig setups explicitly created by the user.

### 🔌 Port Connectivity Note

The entries in `connectedInPorts` and `connectedOutPorts` are **automatically generated by the MIDI Router server** to reflect real-time port connections.  
- 🚫 These values should **never be edited manually** or by AI agents.  
- ⚙️ Any changes to port connectivity should be made by updating physical connections not by modifying the config file.

### 📝 Dropdown Explanation Policy

When explaining what the `MidiRouterConfig.json` file does, **only list the names of available dropdown lists** (as shown in the "Shared Dropdown Lists" section).  
Do **not** display the actual contents of dropdown lists unless the user explicitly requests them.  
If a user control uses a dropdown, mention the dropdown's name, but do not show its values by default.  
Dropdown list values are stored as entries separated by newline characters (`\n`).
