# Presets

Presets are containers for user configurations. You can toggle them via mouse click or MIDI event. 
Each preset defines it's own settings for all available inputs.

## Notes

While multiple presets can be active, it's often best to use only one at a timeâ€”especially when  custom input settings  like 14-bit or clock routing applied.
This will avoid confusion about which input config is in effect.
